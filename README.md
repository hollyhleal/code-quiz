# code-quiz

In this project, I created custom HTML, CSS and JavaScript files to develop a code quiz to test the user's knowledge in JavaScript.

What I have completed:

1. On page load, the directions for the quiz are displayed.
2. When the user clicks the "Start Quiz" button, the timer starts ticking at the top of the page.
3. When the user clicks the "Start Quiz" button, they are brought to the first question of the quiz.
4. The question and choices display on the page.
5. When the user clicks any answer, it returns a message on if they were correct or incorrect in their choice.
6. The questions iterate through until the user has completed all questions in the game.

What I am working on:

1. Subtracting time from the clock when a user gets a question wrong.
2. The game conclusion when the timer reaches zero or the user has answered all questions.
3. Local storage to capture the initials and score of the player from the current game.
